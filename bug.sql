In SQL, a common error is the unexpected behavior of implicit type conversions.  For example, comparing a string column to a numeric value without explicit casting might yield unexpected results.  If the database attempts to implicitly convert the string to a number, it could lead to inaccurate comparisons or unexpected boolean results. Consider this scenario:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price = '100';
```

If the `price` column is of type `INT`, and some rows have values like '100.50' or '100abc', the implicit type conversion will likely cause these rows to not be selected, possibly leading to incorrect query outputs.   Another example is joining tables based on columns with different data types without explicit type casting, such as joining on `INT` and `VARCHAR` columns representing the same entity.
